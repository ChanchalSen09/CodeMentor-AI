# 🎓 CodeMentor AI - DSA Learning Assistant

An AI-powered learning assistant that helps you understand Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) problems, build your own approaches, and debug your code - **without giving you copy-paste solutions**.

## 🌟 Philosophy

CodeMentor AI is designed to help you **learn**, not just get answers. It will:
- ✅ Help you understand problem requirements and concepts
- ✅ Guide you to build your own approach step-by-step
- ✅ Debug your code by teaching you debugging strategies
- ✅ Provide hints and explanations
- ❌ **Never** provide complete copy-paste solutions
- ❌ **Never** do your homework for you

## 🚀 Features

### 1. **Problem Understanding**
Break down complex DSA problems into understandable concepts:
- Identify key concepts and patterns
- Understand input/output requirements
- Recognize constraints and edge cases

### 2. **Approach Building**
Get guided through building your own solution:
- Start with simple approaches
- Identify relevant data structures
- Outline algorithms step-by-step
- Analyze time and space complexity

### 3. **Code Debugging**
Learn to debug effectively:
- Systematic debugging strategies
- Common pitfall identification
- Edge case considerations
- Logic tracing techniques

### 4. **Concept Explanation**
Understand DSA concepts deeply:
- Binary Search
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Hash Maps
- Dynamic Programming
- And more!

### 5. **Smart Hints**
Get hints that guide without spoiling:
- Pattern recognition
- Algorithm suggestions
- Strategy recommendations

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChanchalSen09/CodeMentor-AI.git
cd CodeMentor-AI

📖 UNDERSTAND A PROBLEM
Describe your problem:
> Find the two numbers in an array that add up to a target sum

🧠 Let's break down this problem:

1. Key Concepts to Consider:
   - What data structures might be relevant here?
   - What are the input/output requirements?
   - What are the constraints (time/space complexity)?

2. Questions to Ask Yourself:
   - What patterns do you recognize in this problem?
   - Have you solved similar problems before?
   - What would a brute force solution look like?

### For Self-Learners
- Get guidance without spoilers
- Develop debugging skills
- Understand patterns and approaches
- Learn at your own pace

### For Interview Preparation
- Practice thinking through problems aloud
- Learn to break down complex problems
- Understand common patterns
- Improve problem-solving methodology

## 🛡️ Anti-Cheating Design

CodeMentor AI is specifically designed to prevent academic dishonesty:

1. **No Complete Solutions**: The system never provides ready-to-submit code
2. **Guided Learning**: All help is educational and teaches problem-solving
3. **Understanding First**: Emphasizes comprehension over answers
4. **Process-Oriented**: Focuses on the "how" and "why", not just the "what"

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Potential future features:
- [ ] Integration with OpenAI/Claude APIs for enhanced responses
- [ ] Web interface for easier access
- [ ] Problem difficulty assessment
- [ ] Progress tracking and learning paths
- [ ] Code complexity analysis
- [ ] Visual algorithm explanations
- [ ] Support for multiple programming languages

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.

### Guidelines:
1. Maintain the learning-focused philosophy
2. Never add features that provide complete solutions
3. Ensure code is well-documented
4. Follow Python best practices

### Branch Protection
This repository uses branch protection rules to maintain code quality. See [BRANCH_PROTECTION.md](BRANCH_PROTECTION.md) for details on:
- Required pull request reviews
